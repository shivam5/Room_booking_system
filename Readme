Project Details
================
This is a simple room booking system made in C++.

Task description
------------------
1. Write a program for an online room booking system. The program should have  
capability to add new room to the system. 
2. Read the room details from the file “ROOM.txt” and add to the system using the  
add functionality. You can assume maximum number of rooms to be 1000. 
3. Extend the system to add Labs which have the following attributes: name, area,  
number of doors, location (X,Y), and number of computers. Read the lab details  
from the file “LAB.txt” and add to the system. 
4. Further extend the system to have lecture halls with the following attributes:  
name, area, number of doors, location (X,Y), number of chairs. Read the details  
from the file “LEC.txt” and add to the system.

Functionalities 
The developed system should implement the following functionalities: 
1. The program should be able to add rooms, labs, or lecture halls to the system  
dynamically. 
2. The program should be able to remove a room, lab, or lecture hall from the  
system. 
3. The program should have a mechanism to book a room, lab, or lecture hall. 
4. A person needs 30 units of the area to sleep in a room. The program should give  
the minimum number of rooms required to accommodate given number of  
persons. 
5. The program should be able to find the smallest lecture hall that can  
accommodate the given number of students [use chair information]. 
6. The program should find the lab with least equipment density (computers per  
area unit) and should be able to add new equipment to the system[increasing the  
number of equipments is sufficient]. 
7. Find a room nearest to the given location. 
8. Mechanism to book or un­book a room, lab, and lecture hall. 
9. Program should be able to print all details of the given room, lab, and lecture hall.  
10. When you exit the program, the system must store current booking status in a  
text file. The text file is loaded back to memory when the program starts again.

COMPILING AND RUNNING PROGRAM
====================================
1. Extract the contents of this archive in a folder.
2. Open terminal.
3. Navigate to the folder which contains all these files using cd commands.
4. Type make and press enter. This will automatically compile main.cpp, room.cpp, lab.cpp, lec.cpp to create object files main.o, room.o, lab.o and lec.o and links them and create a file prog which is necessary executable file.
5. Type ./prog and press enter.
6. The program would run, just follow the instructions from there.
7. Press and enter 10 to exit the program.
8. In case you give some wrong input, press Ctrl+Z to break the infinite loop that would be going on.


IMPLEMENTATION
================
The room management system is implemented in C++. The program is implemented using vectors.
Three classes have been made namely room, lab and lec.


FILE INFORMATION
====================
Header Files -  room.h -> Stores definitions for room class
		lab.h -> Stores definitions for lab class
		lec.h -> Stores definitions for lec class
		conio.h -> To implement a function mainly used for waiting - getch()

CPP Files -   main.cpp -> Contains the main program
		room.cpp -> Declarations related to room class
		lab.cpp -> Declarations related to lab class
		lec.cpp -> Declarations related to lec class

Text Files - 	ROOM.txt -> Contains all room details in the given format of the input file
		bookroom.txt -> Contains the booking information for rooms. Contains name of room and 0/1 for booking status.
		LAB.txt -> Contains all lab details in the given format of the input file
		booklab.txt -> Contains the booking information for labs. Contains name of lab and 0/1 for booking status.
		LEC.txt -> Contains all lecture hall details in the given format of the input file
		booklec.txt -> Contains the booking information for lecture halls. Contains name of room and 0/1 for booking status.

Makefile - File used to compile and link all the various cpp files in one go - Easy compilation.
